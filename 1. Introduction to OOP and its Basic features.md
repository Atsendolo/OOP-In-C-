# Introduction to OOP Basic Features

## **o  Introduction to OOP:**

### **•  Definition:**

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of objects, which contain ***data (attributes)*** and ***methods (functions)*** that operate on the data.

•  Instead of focusing only on functions and logic (like in C), OOP focuses on data + behavior together.

•  In C++, classes are used to create objects, and these objects interact to form programs.

### **Basic Features of OOP.**

OOP is based on the following four key principles:

**1. Encapsulation
<br>2. Abstraction
<br>3. Inheritance
<br>4. Polymorphism**

### **1. Encapsulation (Data Hiding & Binding)**

Encapsulation is the concept of hiding data and restricting direct access to it. Data is kept private and can only be accessed using public methods (getters and setters).

Helps in data security by using access specifiers:

• private → accessible only inside the class.

• protected → accessible in class & derived classes.

• public → accessible anywhere.

**👉 Example:**

```C++
class Student {
private:
    int age;  // Private variable

public:
    void setAge(int a) { age = a; }  // Setter function
    int getAge() { return age; }  // Getter function
};
```

**🔹 Advantages:**

- Protects data from accidental modification.
- Maintains ***data integrity and security.***
- Increases code maintainability.
  
### **2. Abstraction (Showing Essential Details, Hiding Complexity)**

Abstraction is the process of ***hiding unnecessary details*** from the user and only exposing the essential features of an object.

**👉 Example**:

```C++
class Car {
public:
    void start() {
        ignition();
        cout << "Car started!" << endl;
    }

private:
    void ignition() { cout << "Engine ignited!" << endl; }
};
```

**🔹 Advantages:**

- ***Simplifies complex systems*** by hiding implementation details.
- Reduces code complexity and increases reusability.
- Improves ***security*** by restricting access to certain functionalities.

### **3. Inheritance**

Inheritance is a feature that allows a ***new class (child class)*** to inherit properties and methods from an ***existing class (parent class)***. This promotes ***code reusability*** and establishes a relationship between classes.

**👉 Example**:

```C++
// Parent class
class Animal {
public:
    void eat() {
        cout << "This animal eats food." << endl;
    }
};

// Child class
class Dog : public Animal {
public:
    void bark() {
        cout << "Dog barks!" << endl;
    }
};
```

**🔹 Advantages:**

- ***Code reusability*** (No need to rewrite common functionalities).
- Establishes a ***hierarchical relationship*** between classes.
- Reduces ***code duplication.***

### **4. Polymorphism**

Polymorphism means ***“one name, multiple forms.”*** It allows functions or methods to ***behave differently based on the object that calls them.***

There are **two types** of polymorphism:

1. Compile-time Polymorphism (Function Overloading, Operator Overloading)
2. Runtime Polymorphism (Function Overriding using Virtual Functions)

***(a) Function Overloading (Compile-time Polymorphism)***

**👉 Example**:

```C++
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Math {
public:
    int add(int a, int b) { return a + b; }
    double add(double a, double b) { return a + b; } // Function Overloading
};

int main() {
    Math obj;
    cout << "Sum (int): " << obj.add(5, 10) << endl;
    cout << "Sum (double): " << obj.add(5.5, 10.5) << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

***(b) Function Overriding (Runtime Polymorphism)***

**👉 Example**:

```C++
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Animal {
public:
    virtual void makeSound() { cout << "Animal makes a sound." << endl; }
};

class Dog : public Animal {
public:
    void makeSound() override { cout << "Dog barks!" << endl; } // Overriding
};

int main() {
    Animal* animalPtr;
    Dog myDog;
    animalPtr = &myDog;
    animalPtr->makeSound();  // Calls overridden method in Dog class
    return 0;
}
```

**🔹 Advantages:**

- Increases ***flexibility*** and ***scalability*** of code.
- Allows a single interface to be used for different types of objects.
- Improves ***code readability and maintainability.***

**🔹 Advantages of OOP:**

- **Modularity** - (Code is divided into classes and objects.)
- **Reusability** - (Code can be reused using inheritance.)
- **Security** - (Data is hidden using encapsulation and abstraction.)
- **Flexibility & Maintainability** - (polymorphism, abstraction)
- Easier to map with real-world problems
- **Scalability** - Easy to expand programs without modifying existing code.

**Other Features of OOP**

Apart from the four main principles, OOP also provides:

- **Classes and Objects:** A class is a blueprint, and an object is an instance of a class.
- **Constructor and Destructor:** Special methods for object initialization and cleanup.
- **Data Hiding:** Restricting direct access to class members.
- **Dynamic Binding:** Function calls are resolved at runtime.

## Conclusion

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a powerful approach that makes programming ***modular, reusable, scalable, and efficient.*** It is widely used in software development for ***real-world applications like game development, web applications, AI, and more.***
